    <b> <span style ="Color: Black"> The World Wide Web </span> </b>
    <p>The World Wide Web is a collection of html documents.  Your browser makes
      requests via the internet to servers.  These requests are using a
      protocol called HTTP for which the servers respond to the browser displays.
    </p>

  <div>
    <b> <span style ="Color: Black"> HTML </span> </b>
    <p> HTML stands for <em> Hyper Text Markup Language. </em> HTML is made up
      of text content, markup, references to other documents,and links to other
      pages. It is the basis for almost every web page.

  <div>
    <b> <span style ="Color: Black"> HTML Tags and Elements </span> </b>
    <p> HTML Markup is made up of things called tags.  The elements have an
      opening tag and closing of tags such as < b > for bold and < em > for
      italics.  Each tag is meant to specify to the computer what you want to
      do to the text.  For example, < b > will make the text <b> bold. </b>

  <div>
    <b> <span style ="Color: Black"> Computers Are Stupid </span> </b>
    <p> Programmers say that Computers are stupid not to insult computers but to
      explain that computers take everything we write literally.  Computers need
      to know exactly what to do because they can't make inferences as humans do.
      If we don't explain to the computer correctly then this can result in
      issues between the programmer and the machine.

  <div>
    <b> <span style ="Color: Black"> Inline Vs. Block </span> </b>
    <p> Elements are placed into 2 categories; Inline Elements and Block Elements.
    Inline is a break. An inline element does not start on a new line and only
    takes up as much space and width as needed.  Block is a box. It always
    starts on a new line and takes up the full width available to the box.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <b> <span style ="Color: Black"> < Span > Vs. < Div  > </span> </b>
    <p> Span and Div are two different types of elements. Span is an inline
    element and Div is a block element. The < div > element is used as a
    container for other HTML elements.  It doesn't require an attribute and it
    doesn't change the look of a HTML element. The < span > element is used to
    style a certain text within a larger text element. It also doesn't require
    an attribute.
